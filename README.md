DXWebTask: A simple Task List Web Application
=============================================

Resume
======
Here, I present a simple web application to manage a task list. I have developed two different solutions for the Task based on different tecnologies:
* A Java-based RESTFul Api with two simple methods GET and POST. A simple client based on AngularJS and Boostrap invokes these methods in the top of the application. The project was created with maven for project management.  
* As alternative solution I have developed a different solution based on MongoDB+NodeJS+AngularJS+JBootstrap. Note that You have to install NodeJS and MongoDB in your computer to test it.

All files in the projects are properly commented.

Files
=====

* Java based App (Folder): Contains two files: DXWebTask.war file to deploy on a Server and DXWebTask.zip with the files and folders of the maven web JAVA project.
* DXWebTaskAlternative (Folder): This folder contains the files of the Node and MongoDB based solution, including the sample data (subfolder "data")
