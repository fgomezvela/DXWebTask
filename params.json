{"name":"DxWebtask","tagline":"Second task for DX Universal- Recruitment process","body":"DXWebTask: A Simple Task List Management Web Application\r\n========================================================\r\n\r\nResume\r\n======\r\nHere, I present a simple web application to manage a task list. I have developed two different solutions for the Task based on different tecnologies:\r\n* A Java-based RESTFul Api with two simple methods GET and POST. A simple client based on AngularJS and Boostrap invokes these methods in the top of the application. The project was created with maven for project management.  \r\n\r\n* As alternative solution I have developed a different solution based on MongoDB+NodeJS+AngularJS+JBootstrap. Note that You have to install NodeJS and MongoDB in your computer to test it.\r\n\r\nAll files in both projects are properly commented.\r\n\r\nFiles\r\n=====\r\n\r\n* Java based App (Folder): Contains two files: DXWebTask.war file to deploy on a Server and DXWebTask.zip with the files and folders of the maven web JAVA project.\r\n\r\n* DXWebTaskAlternative (Folder): This folder contains the files of the Node and MongoDB based solution, including the sample data (subfolder \"data\")\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n==========\r\n\r\n  * http://nodejs.org/\r\n  * http://www.mongodb.org/\r\n  * https://jersey.java.net/\r\n  * https://angularjs.org/\r\n  * http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/\r\n\r\nAuthor\r\n=======\r\n\r\nFrancisco A.
